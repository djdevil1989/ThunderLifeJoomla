; jOpenSim 0.2.7
;
;
; To get Profile and Search working, you need to copy 2 files into your OpenSimulator bin-folder:
;
; jOpenSim.Profile.dll
; jOpenSim.Search.dll
;
; you find them in /path-to-your-joomla/administrator/components/com_opensim/opensim_modules after installation
;
;
;
; This quickstart is just for insiders, newbies should read the readme.pdf ;)
;
; Most is as it was in previous releases
;
; Here is just the new stuff for a quick start:
;
; Search:
;
; in OpenSim.ini add:
;

[DataSnapshot]
...
	data_services="http://path-to-your-joomla/components/com_opensim/registersearch.php"

[Search]
	SearchURL = http://path-to-your-joomla/components/com_opensim/interface.php

; to enable web search (works only with imprudence, kokua and singularity viewers,...
; add to Robust.ini:

[LoginService]
	SearchURL = "http://path-to-your-joomla/index.php?option=com_opensim&view=inworldsearch&task=viewersearch&tmpl=component&"

; the & at the end is important here for sending the parameters correct to jOpenSim



;
; Profile:
; The Section [Profile] has to move from OpenSim.ini to the end of your included .ini file (e.g. GridCommon.ini) like:
;

[Profile]
	ProfileURL = http://path-to-your-joomla/components/com_opensim/interface.php
	Module = "jOpenSimProfile"

; The line Module is important to add without changes!!!


; Groups:
; There is actually nothing new in the ini files:

[Groups]
    Enabled = true
    Module = GroupsModule
    MessagingEnabled = true
    MessagingModule = GroupsMessagingModule
    ServicesConnectorModule = XmlRpcGroupsServicesConnector
    GroupsServerURI = "http://path-to-your-joomla/components/com_opensim/interface.php"
    NoticesEnabled = true
    XmlRpcServiceReadKey    = 1234
    XmlRpcServiceWriteKey   = 1234

; Messaging:
; for offline messages, also no changes to the last version are required:

[Messaging]
    OfflineMessageModule = OfflineMessageModule
    OfflineMessageURL = http://path-to-your-joomla/components/com_opensim/interface.php
    MuteListModule = MuteListModule
    MuteListURL = http://path-to-your-joomla/components/com_opensim/interface.php
    ForwardOfflineGroupMessages = true

;
; Dont forget, that the Addon's must be enabled in jOpenSim's settings to get them responding to your OpenSimulator
